## Project Overview

In this project, we tackled the problem/task of sorting unsorted array of integers. Our goal was to create an efficient and simple algorithm to solve such problem.

## How to Run the Project

To run our project, follow these steps [update these steps accordingly]:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `code` directory.
3. Run the `rosdav.py` script, which is the entry point of our project.


Make sure you have the required Python version and libraries installed before running the project.

## Summary of Findings

Our findings from the project indicate that this algorithm implements the sorting algorithm using divide and conquer, and sort item in a O(n logn) time. We encountered slower runtime compare to original merge sort. Moving forward, it would be interesting to explore more features of this algorithm and improve its efficiency in the future.

## Additional Notes

- This algorithm will give you same time complexity with the original merege sort, with the time complexity of O(n logn)
- Space complexity for this algorithm is O(n) which implies that it does not take much memory when implementing this algorithm
